    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of boiling water on the stove on high, add a 2 teaspoons of salt (the water should taste as salty as the sea). </li>
        <li>Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small pot or pan on medium to low heat and add minced garlic</li>
        <li>Bring water to the boil and add pasta, set a timeer for the recomended time on the packet. Aldente pasta works best for this recipe, nobody likes soggy pasta.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are constantly checing the minced garlic, you want it to cook slowly and evenly - do not burn it, if you do, start again. You may need to adjust the temperature of the stove as it cooks, turning it down bit by bit as the pan heats up.</li>
        <li>Check the pasta when the timer goes off. If it's ready drain the pasta, reserving a bit in a mug to add at the end if required. Some people prefer to add the pasta water than oil to make it less dry.</li>
        <li>Put the pasta back in the big pot but NOT ON THE HEAT. Now add the cooked garlic, a bit more olive oil and pepper to taste - stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add half a cup of the parmesan cheese, stir through and taste. Keep adding cheese, stirring and tasting until you get your desired taste. I personally thing the more cheese the better, if it ends up drying out a bit add some of the pasta water you saved or some olive oil. Some people may also prefert o add butter.</li>
    </ol>
